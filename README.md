## Synopsis

This card is designed as a drop-in replacement for the original Philips VP415 LaserVision player's front-loader module (P).

## Motivation

The original front loader module uses custom Philips microswitches which can no longer be sourced.  The front-loader module is responsible for detecting the closure of the disc tray and the switches are impacted everytime a LaserDisc is loaded making it a common failure point in VP415s.  In addition, since the disc tray can vibrate during transport, the front-loader module is often damaged when players are moved.

The new module design is intended to use modern components and act as a drop-in replacement for the original requiring no alteration to the VP415.

## Author

The Philips VP415 replacement front-loader module was designed by Simon Inns.
